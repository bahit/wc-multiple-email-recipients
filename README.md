# WooCommerce Multiple Email Recipients
Allows for multiple recipients for WooCommerce E-Mails

WooCommerce emails can only have one email recipient. Sometimes you need more then that. This plugin allows you to set up to five additional email addresses that can be used as additional email recipients for WooCommerce notification emails. You can select which email you want to have multiple recipients via the settings page.
